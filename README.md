# u_mount_alert
I have Written a SHELL script to get a ALERT regarding REMOVAL or ADDITION of mount points in the LINUX system.

This SHELL script will update the user about teh changes in mount points.

The mount points details will be send to the user 
DETAILS such as :--> mount point, usage , total space.

Their are 2 shell scripts 
1. u_mount_alert_detailed.sh
2. mount-alerts.sh
